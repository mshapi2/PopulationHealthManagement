# Population Health Management

In this post I will present a Population Health Management Report using HCUP's in-patient data from hospitals. With the healthcare spending crossing $3.5 trillion and accounting for 17.9 percent of the Gross Domestic Product, there is an urgent need to bring down costs and improve outcomes. Population Health Management is an important tool that is increasingly being used by health care providers to manage and control the escalating costs. The crux of Population Health Management is to use data to improve health outcomes. Tracking, monitoring and bench marking are the three bastions of Population Health Management, aimed at improving clinical and health outcomes while managing and reducing cost.

Be leveraging heath data, Population Health Management can align patient needs with what healthcare systems provide. However in order to truly do Population Health Management we need comprehensive health data. Health data that provides a complete view of a patientâ€™s care throughout their entire patient care experience. Unfortunately health data is fragmanted between claims data, clinical data, prescription drug data etc. making it difficult to aggregate into a cohesive view of the care provided, a key to improving the quality of care. 

For this Population Health Management report, I will be leveraging clinical and socioeconomic in-patient data generated by the hospitals from [HCUP](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/). Hospital care accounts for 33% of the nation's health dollar spending. By analyzing the patient population to gain insight into the socioeconomic, demographics, and overall medical condition of the patients across different geographic regions, health care providers can better understand the quality of care being provided and identify areas for improvement and cost savings. Hospitals can use these reports to optimize care management systems and focus their clinical resources on patients with more urgent need. Understanding the communities they serve through population health reporting can help hospitals transition from fee-for-service payments to value-based care while reducing costs and providing better care.

## About HCUP Data
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project ([HCUP](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/)) is a group of healthcare databases that contain the largest collection of longitudinal hospital care data in the United States. HCUP captures information extracted from administrative data (billing records) after a patient is discharged from the hospital, and it contains clinical and nonclinical information on all patients regardless of payer. The schema includes socioeconomic demographic data such as age, gender, income, zip code, payer type, information on admission and discharge, various diagnosis, procedures, charges, a total of about 600 columns. The Population Health Report presented here can be recreated for HCUP data for your state easily. The code to read HCUP data can be found in this notebook [here](https://github.com/Azure/cortana-intelligence-population-health-management/blob/master/Azure%20Data%20Lake/ManualDeploymentGuide/Model/ReadHCUPdata.ipynb) and a data sample can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/cortana-intelligence-population-health-management/tree/master/Azure%20Data%20Lake/ManualDeploymentGuide/Model/SampleHCUPdata). 

Using Power BI, I have created some example reports showing the types of summarization and tracking we can do with this kind of data. These reports shed light on the quality of care being provided and allows monitoring and bench-marking of critical metrics and provide actionable intelligence. Some of the reports that I have created are Patients Stats, Health Stats, Length of stay report, Cost report, Intervention Profile and Readmission Tracking. I will describe these reports briefly below.
