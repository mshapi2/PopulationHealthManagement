# Population Health Management

In this post I will talk about Population Health Management and present a Population Health Report using HCUP's in-patient data from hospitals. With the healthcare spending crossing $3.5 trillion and accounting for 17.9 percent of the Gross Domestic Product, there is an urgent need to bring down costs and improve outcomes. Population Health Management is an important tool that is increasingly being used by health care providers to manage and control the escalating costs. The crux of Population Health Management is to use data to improve health outcomes. Tracking, monitoring and bench marking are the three bastions of Population Health Management, aimed at improving clinical and health outcomes while managing and reducing cost.

Be leveraging heath data, Population Health Management can align patient needs with what healthcare systems provide. In order to truly do Population Health Management we need comprehensive health data. Health data that provides a complete view of a patientâ€™s care throughout their entire patient care experience. Unfortunately health data is fragmanted between claims data, clinical data, prescription drug data etc. making it difficult to aggregate into a cohesive view of the care provided, a key to improving the quality of care. 

For this Population Health Management report, I will be leveraging clinical and socioeconomic in-patient data generated by the hospitals from [HCUP](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/). Hospital care accounts for 33% of the nation's health dollar spending. By analyzing the patient population to gain insight into the socioeconomic, demographics, and overall medical condition of the patients across different geographic regions, health care providers can better understand the quality of care being provided and identify areas for improvement and cost savings. Hospitals can use these reports to optimize care management systems and focus their clinical resources on patients with more urgent need. Understanding the communities they serve through population health reporting can help hospitals transition from fee-for-service payments to value-based care while reducing costs and providing better care.

### About HCUP Data
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project ([HCUP](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/)) is a group of healthcare databases that contain the largest collection of longitudinal hospital care data in the United States. HCUP captures information extracted from administrative data (billing records) after a patient is discharged from the hospital, and it contains clinical and nonclinical information on all patients regardless of payer. The schema includes socioeconomic demographic data such as age, gender, income, zip code, payer type, information on admission and discharge, various diagnosis, procedures, charges, a total of about 600 columns. The Population Health Report presented here can be recreated for HCUP data for your state easily. The code to read HCUP data can be found in this notebook [here](https://github.com/Azure/cortana-intelligence-population-health-management/blob/master/Azure%20Data%20Lake/ManualDeploymentGuide/Model/ReadHCUPdata.ipynb) and a data sample can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/cortana-intelligence-population-health-management/tree/master/Azure%20Data%20Lake/ManualDeploymentGuide/Model/SampleHCUPdata). 

Using Power BI, I have created some example reports showing the types of summarization and tracking we can do with this kind of data. These reports shed light on the quality of care being provided and allows monitoring and bench-marking of critical metrics and provide actionable intelligence. Some of the reports that I have created are Patients Stats, Health Stats, Length of stay report, Cost report, Intervention Profile and Readmission Tracking. I will describe these reports briefly below. 

## Patient Stats
![](media/phm2.PNG)
In the Patient stats report, I have created a snapshot of the patient population. We look at total admits by age, gender, race, income, admit type, payer type, total admits and total charge by payer. Such demographic breakdown of the population can help the hospitals better understand and serve their patients' unique needs. The selectors on the right-hand side of the report allow us to compare results across different hospitals and over time. We also track total admits, average charge per day, average charge per admit, readmission Rate, average length of stay across different hospitals and over time.

## Health Stats

In the Health stats report, I have created an overview of the medical condition of the patient population. Knowing which diagnosis and procedures are most frequent at a given hospital can help with resource planning for both personnel and inventory management. In this report, we look at total admits by primary diagnosis, by MDC (Major Diagnostic Category) and by most frequent procedures performed. We also look at total admits for chronic conditions, broken down by Age and Gender.

## Length of stay report

With standardized payments hospitals are incentivized now more than ever to promote shorter stays. They are hard pressed to use resources more efficiently and find ways to accommodate more patients with the same volume of resources. In the length of stay report, we display the average length of stay by payer type, gender, age and procedures. We also look at variation in average length of stay by condition (diagnosis) and the associated average total charge. An insight into the conditions and demographic subgroups with the longest length of stay can help hospitals devise measures to reduce the average length of stay. A comparison across different hospitals can also help identify best practices or lack thereof around ensuring an optimal length of stay.

## Cost report

In the Cost report we get insights into how costs are distributed across different segments of the population (e.g. patient age, disease and payer type). We look at total charges by payer and gender as well as the total charge per day broken down by payer type. 
It is a known fact that the majority of total health care expenses come from a small percent of the total population as is evident by the data here (in the chart % of Admits by Cost). Insights like these can enable us to drill down and investigate the factors contributing to the majority of the costs. We also identify the most expensive health conditions and calculate mean hospital costs per day per visit and look at total cost per admit for different conditions. A comparison of cost per admit across different hospitals can be helpful in identifying the variability in costs incurred between different hospitals. Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and treating them incurs a huge economic burden. Readmissions are another source of increased hospital costs to the tune of billions of dollars. In the cost report we track the total costs and the proportion of total costs that went towards treating patients with chronic disease. We also track costs associated with readmissions for each hospital.

## Intervention Profile
![](media/phm6.PNG)

Hospital readmissions has been identified as one of the key areas that has the potential for cost savings. Readmissions apart from being costly, also place patients at greater risk of complications and healthcare-associated infections. Nearly one in five hospital patients covered by Medicare are readmitted within 30 days, accounting for $15 billion a year.

Timely intervention by identifying the right patients and causes for readmission can go a long way in reducing these costs. In this report, we identify the conditions that cause the most readmissions and related costs, broken down by payer and age. These insights can help decisions around which conditions to target to reduce readmission to maximize cost-reduction efforts. This report also examines prevalence of chronic conditions by age. These insights can help identify populations to target with interventions, thereby enhancing the quality of care quality.

## Readmission Tracking
![](media/phm7.PNG)
Hospital readmission is a key measure for assessing the performance of the health care system. We have identified readmission here using the same "all-cause" definition as Medicare: if a patient is admitted to any hospital within 30 days after being discharged from an earlier hospitalization, for any reason (including unrelated medical issues), the hospital visit is considered a readmission.
In this report we track readmission rate for conditions targeted by Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) viz. heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), elective hip or knee replacement, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and some other common conditions at each hospital. There is also a metric file used for this visualization that contains the goals set by a hospital regarding their readmission rate. By regularly monitoring the readmission rate, hospitals can be proactive and empirical in their approaches to meeting their target. For example, if there is ongoing effort to improve discharge and care transition practices in order to reduce readmissions, hospitals can monitor progress on these efforts by tracking their metrics using this report.

Above I presented some examples of Population Health Reporting for hospitals using in-patient data. The insights obtained from such reporting can help in managing the health of the population and help reduce cost with better health outcomes.
